                <p class="disclaimer-text">
                    SchoolAI is a satirical demonstration of AI confidence vs. accuracy. 
                    None of the "facts" presented should be used for actual academic work. 
                    Always verify information from reliable sources. This is a humorous 
                    presentation website showcasing how AI can sound convincing while being 
                    completely wrong. Stay in school, kids! 📖
